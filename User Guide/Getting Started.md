**ADEX** is a browser-based application that enables data sharing of real-time information using a self-service portal that will run from **Government Commercial Cloud (GCC)** on both internet and intranet. 

In **ADEX**, a government agency can act as a publisher to publish real-time data. For example, the National Environment Agency (NEA) may publish and share health-related information about Covid-19 cases, see use cases scenario as an example.
