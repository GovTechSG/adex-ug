## Why does ADEX (a data exchange platform) need to cache data?
 
As a data exchange platform, our system is primarily a pass-through platform, but we do cache data for up to 7 calendar days only. The reason for this caching is to make the data temporarily available in case it needs to be recalled or retrieved, for example due to certain packets being lost for whatever reasons during transmission or system downtime.
 
We understand that the data we handle may be restricted, and we take the responsibility of protecting it very seriously. Therefore, we have implemented a caching policy that ensures that agency/company's data is cached for up to 7 calendar days only. This means that after 7 days, the cached data will be automatically deleted from our system, and any subsequent requests for the data will need to be retrieved from the original source.
 
We encourage requesters to retrieve data directly from the original source for anything that is more than 7 calendar days old. This helps to ensure that the most up-to-date and accurate data is being used, and that any changes or updates to the data are reflected in the requester's records.
