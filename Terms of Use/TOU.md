3.2.	Subject to these Terms of Use, GovTech grants to you a non-exclusive, revocable, and non-transferable right to access and use the Service for personal or internal purposes only, and only for such use permitted by the functions of the Service and intended by GovTech. You shall not, amongst other things, benchmark, reproduce, modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, adapt, publish, redistribute or sublicense the Service or any part of the Service without the prior written consent of GovTech or the respective third party owners. You also shall not use the Service in violation of any applicable laws or agreements that you have with any third parties. All express or implied rights to the Service not specifically granted herein are expressly reserved to GovTech.

3.3.2.	Deny or restrict access to or use of the Service by any particular person without ascribing any reasons whatsoever; and

You shall further upon notice from GovTech return or destroy all copies of the Service or materials therein that you may have been provided with.

3.4.	You will not interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service or otherwise do anything that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on GovTech’s servers.

**3A.**   **Account Access and Security**

3A.1 You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of any authentication credentials associated with your use of the Service, including the security of any of your devices which store the authentication credentials. 

3A.2 GovTech shall be entitled, but not obliged, to verify the identity of the person using the Service.  Without prejudice to the foregoing, GovTech is not under any duty to verify that any biometric identifier used with the Service, or on your device, belongs to you.

3A.3 GovTech shall have the sole and absolute discretion to invalidate any authentication credentials at any time, or require you to have to re-authenticate or refresh your authentication credentials at any time, without having to give any reason for the same.

3A.4 GovTech shall be entitled, but not obliged, to act upon or rely on any instructions, information, transmissions of data, or communications received from the account or use of the Service in relation to your authentication credentials, as if such instructions, information, data or communications were issued by you, whether or not the same was authorized by you.

3A.5 For the avoidance of doubt, you are solely responsible for any loss of whatever nature arising from unauthorized or unofficial modifications made to your device which permit or escalate privileged access, or remove restrictions to such access, which are not intended by the manufacturer or provider of your device or operating system of your device (e.g., “rooting” or “jailbreaking” your mobile phone).

**4.**	**Third Party Materials**

4.1.	The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of software or services of a third party (“**Third Party**”). In such an event, there may be terms of use of the third party software or service (the “**Third Party Terms**”). GovTech may be required under or as a result of the Third Party Terms to notify you of certain terms that apply to you (either directly as an end user, or as a party whose acts or omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms) when you use the Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source software terms or standard form terms of the distribution platform from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or user of the distribution platform (the “**Distribution Terms**”). Information on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, already accounted for in these Terms of Use, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or otherwise indicated in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt, insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from which you obtained a copy of the software or application that is part of the Service. For example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s Distribution Terms. 

4.2.	**It is your responsibility to check and read the most up-to-date versions of these Third Party Terms and you are deemed to have notice of the same**. In particular, you are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms that GovTech (under the Third Party Terms) is required to notify you, and you unconditionally agree to be bound by all the obligations in the Third Party Terms which are applicable to you (whether as end user, or as a party whose acts or omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms, or otherwise).  For the avoidance of doubt, where Third Party Terms are listed, such Third Party Terms shall be deemed to include any privacy policies and acceptable use policies as are applicable to you.

4.3.	If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement directly with the Third Party, then you unconditionally agree to enter into such agreement, and in any event, to be legally bound by the Third Party Terms. For the avoidance of doubt:

4.3.1.	some Third Party Terms (particularly open-source terms) permit either a direct licence to you from the Third Party or a sublicence from GovTech to you. In such cases, your licence is a direct licence from the Third Party to you; and

4.3.2.	the terms of your agreement with the Third Party will govern your use of the 	relevant third party software or service, and not these Terms of Use.
 
4.4.	If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to incorporate certain terms in these Terms of Use (inclusive of terms which impose any minimum or maximum standards herein, and/or terms described in Clause 4.5 below), such terms are deemed to have been so incorporated (the “**Incorporated Terms**”). Examples of Incorporated Terms include provisions which require GovTech to give you notice of certain rights and liabilities or require GovTech to ensure that you acknowledge certain matters. Similarly, if the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require these Terms of Use to be altered such that the Third Party Terms are complied with, the parties herein agree that the Terms of Use shall be deemed to be so altered but only to the extent necessary for compliance.

4.5.	Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech to grant the Third Party, direct rights of enforcement of these Terms of Use as a third party beneficiary, against you. Such Third Party Terms are deemed to have been incorporated into these Terms of Use as Incorporated Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such Third Party, such direct rights of enforcement against you.

4.6.	For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the extent of any inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Third Party Terms, the latter shall prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms increases the liability of GovTech beyond that stated in Clause 6. 

4.7.	Without prejudice and in addition to the foregoing, GovTech shall not be responsible for your use of any software or service of a Third Party.

**5.**	**Your Consent to Your Data and to Access Functions of Your Device** 

5.1.	You hereby grant to GovTech a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free right to collect, use, disclose, process, modify, adapt, create derivative works of, reproduce, and sublicense any and all information or data submitted, uploaded or shared by you to the extent necessary to provide the Service or for any other purpose expressly or impliedly provided in these Terms of Use, or as permitted by law. 

5.2.	Use of the Service may require you to allow access by the Service to certain functions of your device, such as push notifications, the obtaining and/or sharing of your location, or the collection of data from you in connection with the Service. Your use of the Service shall constitute your consent to the access by the Service of such functions of your device as may be reasonably required by the Service.

5.3.	You further irrevocably and unconditionally waive, and shall cause to be irrevocably and unconditionally waived, all existing and future moral rights (including the right of identification) wherever in the world in respect of any information or data submitted, uploaded or shared by you (including feedback, requests or suggestions concerning the Services) to GovTech. Such waiver shall also extend to GovTech’s licencees, assigns and successors-in-title.

5.4.	Please also see clause 8 (Privacy Statement).

**5A.**	**Ownership of Feedback/Requests/Suggestions**

You agree that all title and interest in any feedback, requests or suggestions from you concerning the Services provided to GovTech shall be owned by GovTech and, without prejudice and in addition to clause 5.3, you shall waive all rights existing in or in respect of the same (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any signature requirements).

**5B.**	**Confidentiality**

5B.1	If you receive information or data (in whatever form) from GovTech or a Third Party which is designated confidential or proprietary or is otherwise reasonably understood to be confidential or proprietary (collectively, “**Confidential Information**”), you shall not use, disclose or reproduce the Confidential Information except for the purpose for which it was provided to you. If consent to disclose the Confidential Information to a third party is given by GovTech or the Third Party to you, any act or omission in respect of the Confidential Information by that person shall be deemed to be your act or omission and you agree to be fully liable for the same. In all cases, you shall protect the Confidential Information to the same extent you protect your own confidential information but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. You shall ensure that any recipients are bound by confidentiality terms at least as restrictive as this Clause.

5B.2	You shall destroy any Confidential Information immediately upon request by GovTech or the Third Party.

5B.3	In the event:

5B.3.1 you are, or likely to be, required by an order of court to disclose Confidential Information; or
	
5B.3.2 you have reasonable grounds to suspect the unauthorised use or disclosure or reproduction of Confidential Information;
	you shall immediately notify GovTech or the Third Party of the same and cooperate with GovTech or the Third Party to prevent or limit such disclosure.
	
5B.4	Nothing in this Clause 5B shall prejudice GovTech’s or the Third Party’s other rights at law.
