</table>


- **[TechPass](User%20Guide/Home%20Page?id=log-in)** login has been integrated with ADEX portal, users should be able to log in to ADEX using their TechPass credentials.	 
- This means user can use their TechPass username and password to access ADEX and will be able to access multiple SGTS services that have been integrated with TechPass.	 
- Users will have a more streamlined and secure experience when accessing [SGTS](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/singapore-government-tech-stack/) services.


<table>	 
 <tr style="background:none;"> 
 <td><div style=text-align:left;>
 <h4><b>Password</b></h4></div></td>
 </tr>
</table>


- As per security policies, ADEX user password expires after 1 year, to change password see **[Password](User%20Guide/Home%20Page?id=forgot-password)**. 
- It is important for users to change their passwords on a regular basis to ensure the security of their accounts. By forcing users to change their passwords every 1 year, the risk of a compromised account is reduced, as attackers would have a limited window of time to use a stolen password.	 
- In addition to password expiration, ADEX services also implemented other security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, regular security audits, and monitoring for suspicious activity, to help keep ADEX user information secure.
