# ADEX Support

To report an issue or request for a service from the ADEX team, you can raise a support ticket via the ADEX support form at https://go.gov.sg/adexsupport.

**Upcoming changes**

To raise a support ticket after 25 November 2024, an Atlassian account is required. You can refer to the instructions below:

- For users with a TechPass account, follow the steps to [create an Atlassian account for TechPass users](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-planning-tools/access-atlassian-cloud).

- For users without a TechPass account, follow the steps to [create an Atlassian account for non-TechPass users](/Support/non-techpass.md).
